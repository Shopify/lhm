    # more changes here, please consider either:
    #
    # 1. Letting users only specify part of defined clauses (i.e. don't allow
    # `filter` on Migrator to accept both WHERE and INNER JOIN
    # 2. Changing query building so that it uses structured data rather than
    # strings until the last possible moment.
